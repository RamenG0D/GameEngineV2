# GameEngine V2

## This is my second attempt at any sort of game engine, the first is archived now
this project is a challenge/hobby, where I only use native java libraries to make a game engine and even some renders.

it should include
- TODO
  - ~~Vectors~~
  - ~~Image Renderer/Loader~~
  - A 3D Renderer
  - A 2D Renderer -> I'll be working on improving 2D for now
  - A World To Manage things
  - ECS(Entity Component System)...
  - Easy Menus/(Menu Creator)
  - ~~Image buffer / pixel buffer~~
  - Sprites / animation loader
  - making a wiki to remind myself how it works / what i was thinking when i made a new change
  - doom style render and doom map creator
  - raycastor engine test
  - ~~Easy keys~~
