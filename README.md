# GameEngine V2

## This is my second attempt at any sort of game engine, the first is archived now
this project is a challenge/hobby, where I only use native java libraries to make a game engine and even some renders.

- TODO
  - ~Vectors~
  - ~Image Renderer/Loader~
  - A 3D Renderer-> Almost have a working one, in the mean time just use the generic but fast raycaster thats already working
  - A 2D Renderer -> will improve later
  - ECS(Entity Component System)
  - Easy Menus/(Menu Creator)
  - Sprites / animation loader -> animation loader specifically
  - making a wiki to remind myself how it works / what i was thinking when i made a new change
  - doom style render and doom map creator
  - ~raycastor engine test~
  - Audio loader / player
  - main system could use a rework in terms of initialization
   i might even deprecate the current App class but the core of what it does will be the same
  - general refactors and stuff
  - considering moving the graphical portions to javaFX... still it might not work out
  - and finally i need to work on multi thread more and adding the functionality to more easily multi thread stuff
